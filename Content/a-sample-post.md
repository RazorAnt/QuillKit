This blog post uses [Markdown][1]. It supports **standard** markdown syntax.  In addition, there are a handful of helper codes for videos (youtube and vimeo) and for working with images with lightbox.

[lightboxright src="http://i.imgur.com/fRWjlqH.jpg"] This is a lightbox image on the right.  There is a left option as well.  These require a clear below. 

You can use the lightbox by itself or lightboxmax to have the image at max width.  

Below this section is a gallery.  You can set 1, 2, or 3 columns across and it sizes everything for you and clicking the images displays them via lightbox.
